## ⚾ What is "League Age"?

"League Age" is the official age a player is considered for the season.  
It may differ from the player’s actual birthday age because it is based on a **cut-off date** defined by the league:

- **Baseball:** April 30  
- **Softball:** August 30  

> This means a player’s age on the cut-off date is their **League Age** for the entire season.

## 🔢 How the Calculator Works

2. Select the sport (**Baseball** or **Softball**).  
3. Click **Check Age**.
